Hardware

Software
--------

* Adafruit DHT library - https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library
* Bill Greiman's SdFatLib - http://code.google.com/p/sdfatlib/
* JChristensen's Timer library - https://github.com/JChristensen/Timer
* Highstock charts - http://www.highcharts.com/

This is still a work-in-progress. No time for README, must write code!
