Meteoduino
==========

My personal Arduino-based meteorological station. (OK, it's just an Arduino
with an Ethernet shield and some sensors)

Hardware
--------

* Arduino Uno
* Arduino Ethernet Shield
* DHT22 Temperature/Humidity Sensor
* DS1307 RTC Module

Software
--------

* Adafruit DHT library
* SdFatLib
* JChristensen's Timer library

This is still a work-in-progress. No time for README, must write code!
